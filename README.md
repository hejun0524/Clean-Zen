### How to commit to a public repo
Since the repository is public, everyone can fork it (clone the current version to your end), but only commit to their own fork.
They can then ask you to pull some of the changes in their fork into your repository via a pull-request.

### Changing to private repo?
If we want this repo to private, I need everyone's GitHub account and grant you write access.
